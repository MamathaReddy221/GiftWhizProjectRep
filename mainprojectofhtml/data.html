        <li>Make sure your computer has the latest version of anti-virus software. Download the updates of this software on a regular basis to protect your computer against new viruses.</li>

        <li>If you are using a shared computer, you should clear your browser's cache and history after each session so that your account information is removed.</li>
        <li>Do not share any personal information like bank details, date of birth, anniversary date. Winni never saves these details, and we don't ask for such details via e-mails, calls or SMS.</li>
        <li>Do not trust any scheme offers received via calls, SMS or e-mails, which do not reflect on the official website.</li>
        <li>Do check the writing style in e-mails or SMS you receive. Poor spelling and grammar are an indication that the e-mail/SMS you've received may not be from a credible source.</li>
        <li>Never get lured into offers of big amounts or gift items, in exchange for a small amount to be deposited in some bank account. Genuine websites like Winni never indulge in such unusual schemes. Winni never asks their customers to deposit amounts into any bank account for any such gifts or schemes.</li>
