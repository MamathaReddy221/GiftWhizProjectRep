        <h2>Terms and Conditions - For International Orders</h2>
        <p><strong>The actual product may vary in shape, size, brand, and color as per local availability.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>As The “Message on card” service is complementary we might not be able to provide it across all delivery areas. In such cases, we will send a digital gift message.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>If the ordered product is shipped using the services of our courier partners, the date of delivery will be an estimate. The delivery date might change by -2 days or +2 days.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Our courier partners do not call before delivering an order, so we recommend that you provide an address at which someone will be present to receive the package.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Once the order has been shipped then it cannot be modified nor can it be redirected to another address. Redelivery is not possible. If the customer wants the order to be redelivered to the same/new address, a new order needs to be placed.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>In the case of a damaged/different/low-quality product the sender should contact our customer care within 1 working day (between 9 AM TO 6 PM IST) from the date of delivery so that we can take the required
            <p><strong>action.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>We will deduct 10% as cancellation charges if the customer cancels the order 48 hours prior to the delivery, and 20% if the order is canceled between 24 to 36 hours prior to the delivery. If the order is canceled within 24 hours, then no refund is allowed.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>If a product that you have ordered is out of stock or unavailable, we will contact you to give you an option of an alternate product. If we do not get a response from you within 1 hour (For the same day delivery) and 4 hours (For any other type of delivery), then we will proceed with dispatching the alternate product since we know that you are sending it to your loved one(s) on a special occasion and we would not want anything to dampen the spirit of the occasion.</strong></p>
